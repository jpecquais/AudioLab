/*
Attack Hold Release Envelop.
Create an envelop based on an input signal compared to a threshold.

The attack determines how long the envelop take to be fully open, once the signal is superior to the threshold.
The release determines how long the envelop take to be fully closed, once the signal is inferior to the threshold.
The hold determines how long the envelop hold its value before going to the release phase, once the signal is inferior to the threshold.

Based on FAUST function : en.adsr()
